# Two pages report
## The goal/interest to build this application:
#### I am a person who likes small animals.So this time I choose the project which distinguish between two types of dogs that looks very similar (Husky dog and Alaskan Malamute)
## Data source and collection: 
#### At the beginning, I planned to use python script code to automatically grab some pictures so that I don't need to download them one by one.But later in the process I found that it always interrupts unexpectedly for special reasons.I remembered that Mentor mentioned that some websites limit the download of images.So I decided to choose another method. After searching, I found the ImageAssistant plug-in of Google Chrome, which is simple and convenient to operate.![image](https://github.com/Sam-songchen/final-project/blob/master/images/IMAGEASSISTANT.png=200*50)
## Tool/cloud/algorithm that you use to create the model:
#### I use the AutoML to create my model,but I am still trying to use some algorithms to create my model, but there will always be some difficulties, so maybe we'll see the results soon.
