# Two pages report

## The goal/interest to build this application:
#### I am a person who likes small animals.So this time I choose the project which distinguish between two types of dogs that looks very similar (Husky dog and Alaskan Malamute)

## Data source and collection: 
#### At the beginning, I planned to use python script code to automatically grab some pictures so that I don't need to download them one by one.But later in the process I found that it always interrupts unexpectedly for special reasons.I remembered that Mentor mentioned that some websites limit the download of images.So I decided to choose another method. After searching, I found the ImageAssistant plug-in of Google Chrome, which is simple and convenient to operate.![](https://github.com/Sam-songchen/final-project/blob/master/images/IMAGEASSISTANT.png)

## Tool/cloud/algorithm that you use to create the model:
#### I use the AutoML to create my model,but I am still trying to use some algorithms to create my model, but there will always be some difficulties, so maybe we'll see the results soon.![image](https://github.com/Sam-songchen/final-project/blob/master/images/train.png)

## Tradeoffs you madeï¼š

#### We can see that the accuracy rate is not 100%.When we open each label to see the details,we can see that there are some problems in the selection of pictures(It seems that there are same picutures in the different labels).We should be more careful when choosing pictures in the future.We can see that precision and recall reach their highest point,when the confidence comes to 0.5.
